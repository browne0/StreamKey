# StreamKey
A custom iOS keyboard to use on mobile livestreams.

A common problem for users on mobile devices is that when watching livestreams, a user on a mobile device has difficulty of inserting emotes, or icons into twitch chat without typing out the full shortcut.

The goal of this app is to reduce that time, and provide a simple interface for people to get their true chat experience while watching varying streams.
